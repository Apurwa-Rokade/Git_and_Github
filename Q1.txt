Version control is a system that records changes to files over time, enabling you to recall specific 
versions later. It's crucial in software development for several reasons:

1) Tracking Changes: Version control systems (VCS) like Git, SVN, or Mercurial monitor modifications made 
to files, recording every change made to the codebase.

2)Maintaining History: They maintain a history of changes, allowing you to review, revert, or compare 
versions, tracking who made which changes and when.

3)Collaboration & Teamwork: VCS enables collaboration among developers. Multiple team members can work 
on the same project simultaneously, merging their changes seamlessly.

4)Branching & Merging: Developers can create branches to experiment with new features or fixes without 
affecting the main codebase. Later, they can merge these changes back if they're successful.

5)Code Quality & Stability: Version control helps maintain code stability by allowing developers to 
revert problematic changes quickly and ensure a clean, functional codebase.

Importance in Software Development:
Team Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work concurrently on a project without disrupting 
each other's work. It ensures smooth collaboration by tracking changes.

History & Auditing: Provides a historical record of every change, who made it, and why.
This information is invaluable for auditing, debugging, or understanding the evolution of the codebase.

Code Reusability: Facilitates code reuse by allowing easy access to previous versions or branches, 
reducing duplication of effort.
