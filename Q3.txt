Q3. Explain what .gitignore is and why itâ€™s important in version control

The .gitignore file is a text file used by Git to specify files and directories that should be ignored 
and not tracked by version control. It's an essential part of managing a Git repository, especially when
 you have files or directories that you don't want to include in your version control system.

 Maintaining Privacy & Security: Allows exclusion of sensitive information like API keys, passwords, 
 or personal data that shouldn't be shared or stored in a repository.

 Example :Below is .gitignore file

 # Ignore compiled binaries
*.exe
*.dll
*.so

# Ignore log files
*.log

# Ignore files generated by IDEs or editors
.idea/
.vscode/

# Ignore sensitive information
secrets.txt

# Ignore files in a specific directory
logs/


Utilizing .gitignore ensures that your version control system remains focused on the relevant project 
files, enhancing collaboration, security, and repository performance.
