Git Workflow Steps are below:

1)Working on Files:
Create or modify files in the working directory.

2)Stage Changes:
Use git add" to stage specific changes or files for the next commit.
 This moves changes from the working directory to the staging area.

 3)
 Review Changes:

Use 'git status' to review the changes in the staging area and working directory.

4)
Commit Changes:
Use 'git commit' to create a commit with the staged changes. This permanently stores the changes in the 
repository, providing a snapshot of the project's state at that time.

Visial representation:
Working Directory -> Staging Area -> Repository
  (git add)           (git commit)


Untracked files exist only in the working directory.
Staged files are ready to be committed and reside in the staging area.
Committed files are stored as snapshots in the repository.
