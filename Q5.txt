Step-by-Step Guide to Contributing to an Open-Source Project on GitHub:

1)Find a Project:

Search for projects that interest you on GitHub. Look for repositories labeled "good first issue" or 
"beginner-friendly" if you're new to contributing.

2)Fork the Repository:

Go to the project's GitHub page and click on the "Fork" button at the top right corner. 
This creates a copy of the project in your GitHub account.

3)Clone the Forked Repository:

On your forked repository, click on the "Code" button and copy the URL.
Open your terminal, use git clone <URL> to clone the repository to your local machine.

4)Create a Branch:

Use git checkout -b <branch_name> to create a new branch for your contribution.
 The branch name should be descriptive of the changes you'll make.

5)Make Changes:

Edit the code or documentation in your local repository using your preferred code editor.

6)Commit Changes:

Use git add <file> to stage the changes. Then, git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message" to 
commit the changes.

7)Push Changes to Your Fork:

Use git push origin <branch_name> to push your changes to the forked repository on GitHub.


8)Create a Pull Request (PR):

On GitHub, go to your forked repository and click on the "Compare & pull request" button.
Review the changes you've made and provide a descriptive title and message for your pull request.
Click "Create pull request" to submit your changes to the original project's maintainers.

9)Engage in Discussion:

Be open to feedback and engage in discussions related to your pull request. Respond to comments and 
address any requested changes.

10)Continuous Improvement:

Make further changes or improvements based on feedback until your contribution is approved and merged.
